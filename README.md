# Challenge Week Project

## Second Year Computer Science

**Main objectives:**  
1. Implement variable shape of the puzzle.   
2. Modify output type (AI assignment output differs from the expected output of the challenge week instructions).  
3. Implement file reading (use file as input).  
4. Create GUI form to control the program.  
5. Display result using GUI form graphic container and rectangle elements.  
6. Implement points above as fast as possible and spend remaining time implementing additional objectives and refining the program.  

**Additional objectives:**  
* Use file manager to supply the input file (instead of hardcoding the file name).  
* Add ability to select what heuristic is used for A-star algorithm.  
* Neatly output relevant data (eg. algorithm completion time, number of expanded nodes).
